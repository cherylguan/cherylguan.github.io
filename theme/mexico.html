 <p>Sayulita Beaches: Sayulita Beach
        Sayulita Beach
        One of the biggest draws to the Sayulita scene is its main beach. Sayulita Beach is a super-long stretch of golden sand that is teeming with life. This is the place where surfers flock, stand-up paddle boarders head for, babes in itsy-bitsy bikinis sunbathe, Mexican families set up their tents, tourists stop by to watch the show and beach vendors make their daily wage.
        
        Here you’ll find a lively, colorful, crazy scene, at times awhirl with the music of wandering bands, but always loads of fun—especially when the waves get big and the town crew of renowned surfers paddles out and demonstrates how it’s done.
        
        One of the main attractions of this beach is its consistent surf break. The best time to catch the waves is from December to early April when the north swells hit. Although the waves aren’t as high in the summer months, they can still offer a short, yet exciting, ride.</p>
