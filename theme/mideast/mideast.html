                <h2>Chicago</h2>
                <ul>
            
                    <p>To most people, this stainless steel figure is a work of art – but to tourists, it's the best opportunity for a selfie. The Cloud Gate sculpture also known as 'the Bean,' is one of the top things to see in Chicago. The bean is a large public sculpture that was unveiled at the opening of Millennium Park in 2004.</p>

                    <p>The Art Institute boasts the largest collection of impressionist art outside of Paris. Ponder the mesmerizing landscape of Seurat’s A Sunday on La Grande Jatte and peer into the 19th-century before Gustav Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day. In the American collection, marvel at iconic works like the Nighthawks diner scene by Edward Hopper and the Midwestern farmer and daughter depicted in Grant Wood’s American Gothic.</p>
