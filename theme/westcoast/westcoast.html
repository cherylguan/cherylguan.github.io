           <p>Immerse yourself in the animal kingdom at the 100-acre (40-ha) San Diego Zoo, home to more than 4,000 animals across 800 rare and exotic species. Spend quality time with giant pandas, New Zealand kiwis, endangered sun bears, and Galápagos tortoises—the zoo’s oldest residents.

          
            <p>The original image of the moment was captured by photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt on August 14, 1945. J. Seward Johnson is the sculptor of this version, though there has been some debate whether it is actually based on the famous photo. In any event, tourists and old veterans love it, assuming the same pose with a loved one at its base, or just peeking up the nurse's skirt.</p>
